# The Grand Goat Race

Every year there is a Grand Goat Race, and you recieve the data about participating goats in the following format:

`"Bleaters: 01:00:00, Professor Dandelion: 00:30:00, Katherine Jr.: 00:45:00"`

Where we have the name of the goat, followed by their race time in hours, minutes and seconds.

It's your job to write a function which takes in this information, and returns an object summarising the outcome of the race in this form:

```js
{
    firstPlace: "Professor Dandelion",
    lastPlace: "Bleaters",
    averageTime: "00:45:00"
}
```

This describes the winning goat on a key of `firstPlace`, the goat in last place on a key of `lastPlace` and the average time of all the goats in the race, rounded up to the nearest second on a key of `averageTime`. 

**Build up your tests gradually and flexibly, adding separate tests for each key value pair in the returned object.**
