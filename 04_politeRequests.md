# politeRequests

This function takes in three arguments:

  - A string which is an instruction, with a "%" in place of a person's name. Eg. "Feed the cat %"
  - An array of names, e.g. `["Katherine", "Tim", "Caz", "Zanna"]`
  - A boolean which determines whether or not the returned instructions will be polite, with "please" added before their name.

It must return an array of instruction strings, with the % replaced with each  of the names in the array in turn.
If the boolean is `true`, each instruction must also have "please" added to the string before their name.

For example:

```js
politeRequests("Go to the bank %", ["Katherine", "Tim"], true)
// returns ["Go to the bank please Katherine", "Go to the bank please Tim"]

politeRequests("Fetch me a drink %", ["Caz", "Zanna"], false)
// returns ["Fetch me a drink Caz", "Fetch me a drink Zanna"]
```
